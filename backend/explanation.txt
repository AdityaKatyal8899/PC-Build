SQLAlchemy Model (ORM model)

Describes how data is stored and queried inside the database.

Pydantic Model

Describes a data contract for validation and serialization — nothing more.

Request Schema

Defines what the client is allowed to send to your API.

Response Model

Defines what the client is allowed to see from your API.

Role assignment truths (this is critical)

A Pydantic model becomes a request model

When it is used as a function parameter in a route.
